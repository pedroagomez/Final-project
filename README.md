# Final-project

Final project to pass the course, done as a team. It's a social network where users can create content, 
add to favorites, like or dislike, and send messages. There's an administrator user profile.

I am passing the list of users:
Administrator user: pedro --> password : Pedro1234
user: matu --> password : Matu1234
user: tom --> password : Tomas1234
user :Nico --> passowrd: Nico1234
